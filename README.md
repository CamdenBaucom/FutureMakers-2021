Deep learning and AI Summer Program
## Responses
- [X] July 6: What do I hope to learn from this summer?
  - Familiarity with machine learning concepts and syntax in order to become comfortable with AI overall
- [X] July 7: What did I learn from the leadership seminar?
  - The power of stories come from small details that allow the reader to become invested into the moment and the larger theme
- [X] July 8: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Can Scikit-Learn visualize data without a data analysis library?
  - In supervised learning we know what the outputs should be, allowing the program to learn by comparing its output to the expected output. Unsupervised learning on the other hand has no known or "labeled" outputs, so it learns by finding patterns and clustering similar groups of things together. 
  - No, although Scikit-Learn is an easy to use machine learning library, it does not have built-in data analysis, so it must be imported from an external library.
